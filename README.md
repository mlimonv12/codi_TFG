This repository contains the code written for the final project of my degree in Physics.

### Main goals
The main goal of this project is to observe Mott-insulating phases of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model. Using Julia and the libraries ITensors and ITensorMPS, I have implemented Time-Evolving Block decimation to observe the effect of on-site repulsion U and next-neighbour repulsion V on particle ordering.
