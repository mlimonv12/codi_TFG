	abstract = {We prove an area law for the entanglement entropy in gapped one-dimensional quantum systems. The bound on the entropy grows surprisingly rapidly with the correlation length; we discuss this in terms of properties of quantum expanders and present a conjecture on matrix product states which may provide an alternate way of arriving at an area law. We also show that, for gapped, local systems, the bound on Von Neumann entropy implies a bound on Rényi entropy for sufficiently large α\&lt;1 and implies the ability to approximate the ground state by a matrix product state.},

	abstract = {The density-matrix renormalization group method (DMRG) has established itself over the last decade as the leading method for the simulation of the statics and dynamics of one-dimensional strongly correlated quantum lattice systems. In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms.},

It should be a good place for newcomers to get familiarized with some of the key ideas in the field, specially regarding the numerics. After a very general introduction we motivate the concept of tensor network and provide several examples. We then move on to explain some basics about Matrix Product States (MPS) and Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS). Selected details on some of the associated numerical methods for 1d and 2d quantum lattice systems are also discussed.},

At zero temperature, the phase diagram decomposes into six regions: three with homogeneous phases (characterized by particle densities , 1 and 2 and staggered charge density ) and three with staggered phases (characterized by the densities , 1 and and staggered densities , 1, and ). Here we use Pirogov - Sinai theory to analyse the details of the phase diagram of this model at low temperatures. In particular, we show that for any sufficiently low non-zero temperature the three staggered regions merge into one staggered region S, without any phase transitions (analytic free energy and staggered order parameter ) within S.},

	abstract = {Attention is drawn to a class of semi-conductors or insulators with incompletely filled 3d bands. Their lack of conductivity, if the number of electrons per atom is an integer, is explained by the circumstance that a moving electron will have a large probability of being withdrawn to the initial atom, if only the potential barriers to be penetrated are sufficiently high to reduce the frequency of transition below a certain limit. This inhibiting factor disappears, if for ions of equal electronic levels the number of electrons per atom differs from an integer. In the case of NiO this condition is fulfilled if an electron is brought by thermal excitation from the lattice 3d band into the somewhat raised and less occupied levels a, a' (figure 1); these levels belong to Ni ions adjacent to a vacant Ni lattice point introduced by the deviations from stoichiometry, and two of these Ni ions are at the absolute zero Ni3+ ions. An analogous conduction mechanism holds for non-stoichiometric Cu2O, with a completely filled 3d band (figure 2). Photoconductivity is generally observed with substances with completely filled zones and never with substances of the NiO type. A tentative explanation is given for this fact on the basis of the model of figure 1 and figure 2. In non-stoechiometric ZnO vacant oxygen lattice points are assumed (figure 3); in that case the calculation of the lattice levels shows that at the lattice holes one Zn2+ is converted into Zn, whereas in the lattice the additional electrons form Zn+ ions, as will be the case after thermal transitions of the electrons belonging to these Zn atoms into the lattice 4s band.},
